OVERVIEW
Electronic Voting Machine is an electronic device for recording votes.The Project
Electronic Voting System is an interesting project because EVM is a replacement for
ballot papers.This project is for multiple contestants .Voters can easily poll their vote to
any one from the contestants.Evm can be a big help to prevent fake vote,we can easily
kick fake voters. EVM is very easy to transport and maintain. In the real world after
taking a vote via a traditional voting system with ballot papers,Vote counting is a big
problem.To overcome this problem EVM is the only answer.EVMs also do not require
electricity, EVMs run on an ordinary battery thatâ€™s why we want to do this project
